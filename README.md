This project demonstrates how to transform unstructured data into a structured knowledge graph using Amazon Bedrock and Neo4j. The process involves reading various data formats, extracting nodes and relationships using a language model (LLM) from Amazon Bedrock, generating Cypher queries to create the graph in Neo4j, and then uploading the data to Neo4j.

## Knowledge Graph:
A knowledge graph is a structured way of representing knowledge, employing a graph-based data model. It organizes information into nodes and edges, where nodes symbolize entities or concepts, and edges represent the relationships between them. This approach allows for efficient storage, retrieval, and inference of interconnected data, enhancing capabilities for advanced search, analysis, and reasoning tasks.
